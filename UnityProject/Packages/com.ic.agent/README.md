## ICP.NET Integration
Here describes how the [ICP.NET](https://github.com/edjCase/ICP.NET) is integrated, basically explains how the managed dlls under `ICP.NET` folder are generated.

- `EdjCase.ICP.Agent.dll` & `EdjCase.ICP.Candid.dll` are compiled from [ICP.NET](https://github.com/edjCase/ICP.NET) directly, they're targeted to .NET standard 2.0, so itâ€™s okay to use them directly.
